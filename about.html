            <h2> Birth and Upbringing</h2>
            <p> I was born to an Egyptian family in Saudi Arabia. I spent most of my life moving between different cities across both countries, and have been to 10 different schools. This exposure at young age to suburban areas and urban cities, and public schools and international ones have allowed me to grow up perceiving the world from multiple perspectives; moreover, I have become a person who is flexible and can quickly adapt. </p>

            <h2> Egyptian Revolution </h2>
            <p>  I was only 10 when the revolution happened to kick a long standing dictatorship ruling in Egypt. The revolution, with the many events that proceded it, has given me context of how I may be the change I want someday. In addition, it has given the momentum to be the change from a young age, even doing the simplest of things like cleaning and painting my school and the streets. </p>

            <h2> Creating since childhood </h2>
            <p> I have loved to create things from childhood, spanning from meccano cars and airplanes to recycling boxes into robot toys. When I had access for the first time to a PC and Internet at the start of middle school, I, curious as usual, seized the opportunity to explore as much as possible, which have led me to coding and competitive programming.</p>

            <h2> High School and CS </h2>
            <p> I've transferred to Nermien Ismail School (NIS) in Cairo, Egypt from a school in Saudi Arabia. My love for computer science wasn't hampered despite the many obstacles; in the session I took the exam for the IGCSE CS subject, I was only one of two in the whole school taking the subject, and I'm the first ever in the school to take the more advanced level (A-level Computer Science). Seeing the misconceptions people had about CS, I started campaigns to dissect these topics with my peers, which resulted in enrollment increasing from 2-5 students/year to 40-50 students/year.  </p>

            <h2> Entrepreneurship journey </h2>
            <p>  I was inspired at a young age reading the stories of entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and watching Silicon Valley series, aspiring to one day become an entrepreneur, but being a middle schooler in a small suburban area it was only a mere aspiration. However, in 10th grade as soon as I went back to Cairo, I tried to immerse myself in the entrepreneurship and startup scene; I searched for events and went by myself, trying to meet people and seeking opportunities to grow. </p>

            <h2> My first startup </h2>
            <p> After many years, I was desperate when my grandmother had hemiplegia and couldn't use her phone anymore due to tremors. This was my main inspiration behind starting Paraztec, a startup that aims to alleviates some of the pain people who suffer from tremors go through when using technology by developing an electronic glove. This experience had taught me a lot of valuable lessons, and skills; it has shown me the reality of the startup world behind the rose-tinted glasses perspective presneted in movies, and books. </p>
